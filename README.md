This container expects to be run near a folder named landing which includes a folder called pages and a folder called assets. Both are copied into the container to render the website.

It borrows heavily from 
* The styling of the template for this borrows from two sources:
	* [Bootstrap Twitter](http://getbootstrap.com)
	* [SinglePaged - Simple Jekyll template ](http://t413.com/SinglePaged)
* Site building and deployment is facilitated by 
	* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
